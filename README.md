A Credit Card Validator is a software application that verifies the authenticity and validity of credit card numbers using a mathematical algorithm called the Luhn algorithm. This algorithm checks whether the sum of the digits of a credit card number conforms to a specific formula. If the sum meets the formula's requirements, the number is considered valid; otherwise, it's deemed invalid.

The Credit Card Validator is essential for various purposes such as preventing fraud, reducing chargebacks, and ensuring accurate billing. Merchants and financial institutions utilize it to safeguard against fraudulent transactions and to ensure they only accept genuine credit card payments.

I developed a Credit Card Validator using the C++ programming language.

How the Luhn Algorithm works:
The Luhn algorithm functions by summing up the digits of a credit card number and comparing it against a predefined formula. If the sum meets the formula's criteria, the number is deemed valid. Conversely, if the sum fails to meet the criteria, the number is considered invalid.

UI Overview:
This program utilizes the Luhn Algorithm to validate a credit card number.
You can type 'exit' at any point to quit.
Please input a credit card number for validation:
The user will input a credit card number. If the number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm, the program will display 'valid'; otherwise, it will show 'invalid'.
